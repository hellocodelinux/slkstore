python3-pyproject-api (API to interact with pyproject.toml projects)

pyproject-api aims to abstract away interaction with pyproject.toml
style projects in a flexible way.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions due to requiring newer version
of python than is available in Slackware 15.0 (python 3.10).
