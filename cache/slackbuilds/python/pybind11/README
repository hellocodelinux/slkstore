pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++
types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of
existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent
Boost.Python library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code
in traditional extension modules by inferring type information using
compile-time introspection.

This SlackBuild is intended for python3 only.

ADDITIONAL NOTE: On Slackware 15.0, the pybind11 version is frozen
at 2.11.1 due to other SlackBuilds which depend on it. For example,
python3-scipy is being held at version 1.12.0 due to requiring a
newer Cython than included in Slackware, and python3-scipy-1.12.0
requires a version of pybind11 which is less than 2.12.0
