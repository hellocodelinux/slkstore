python3-tox (CLI CI frontend and development task automation tool)

tox aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part
of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testing and release
process of Python software (alongside pytest and devpi).

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions due to requiring newer version
of python than is available in Slackware 15.0 (python 3.10).
