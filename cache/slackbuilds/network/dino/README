dino is super simple jabber client with support for video calls

Dino is written in vala and is well compatible
with Conversations for Android.

Dino does not support neither system tray nor
multiple windows.

To switch theme, run it like:

/usr/bin/env GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark /usr/bin/dino

You can pass VP9=yes if you want to try the VP9 codec
instead of the default VP8, but be aware that many Intel
GPUs do not support hardware acceleration of VP9, and
without hardware acceleration video may stutter or
freeze.
