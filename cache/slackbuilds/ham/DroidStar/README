DroidStar

This software connects to M17, Fusion (YSF/FCS, DN and VW
modes are supported), DMR, P25, NXDN, D-STAR
(REF/XRF/DCS) reflectors and AllStar nodes (as an IAX2
client) over UDP. It is compatible with all of the AMBE
USB devices out there (ThumbDV, DVstick 30, DVSI, etc).
It also supports MMDVM modems and can be used as a
hotspot, or as a stand-alone transceiver via direct mode
to the MMDVM device.

There is a vocoder plugin API available for loading of
vocoder software. Any vocoder plugin used with DroidStar
should be properly licensed by the user if any copyright
patents apply. Do not use any patented vocoder plugin
that you are not licensed to use.
