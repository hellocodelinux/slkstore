Sndio is a small audio and MIDI framework, part of the OpenBSD
project, and ported to FreeBSD, Linux and NetBSD. It provides a
lightweight audio & MIDI server and a fully documented user-space API
to access either the server or the hardware directly in a uniform
way. Sndio is designed to work for desktop applications, but pays
special attention to synchronization mechanisms and reliability
required by music applications. Reliability through simplicity are
part of the project goals.

Before running the SlackBuild script, you must create a sndiod user:

  # mkdir -p /var/run/sndiod
  # useradd -u 389 -g audio -d /var/run/sndiod sndiod
