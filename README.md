## 🚀 What is Slkstore?

Slkstore is a web-based software center designed specifically for **Slackware Linux**. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to browse, search, and manage software packages available from the [SlackDCE](https://slackware.uk/slackdce/) repository.

The main goal of Slkstore is to simplify software management on Slackware, offering an experience similar to the "app stores" found in other operating systems, but with the simplicity and power that characterizes Slackware.

## ✨ Main Features

*   **🗂️ Software Catalog:** Browse a wide collection of software available for Slackware.
*   **🔍 Integrated Search:** Quickly find the applications you need with a powerful and fast search.
*   **📄 Detailed View:** Get all the information about each package, including its description, version, and dependencies.
*   **🎨 Graphical Interface:** An intuitive and clean visual design with icons for each application, making software identification easy and enjoyable.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
